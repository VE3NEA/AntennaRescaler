# Antenna Rescaler

This project is a JupyterLab Notebook that automates re-scaling of the antenna models available on the [DG7YBN web site](http://dg7ybn.de/index.htm) to the desired frequency and element diameter. It automates the manual re-scaling method described by DG7YBN and does the work in seconds. The modified model is evaluated using the NEC engine, and its characteristics and radiation pattern are displayed. The script also has an option to add random offsets to the wire coordinates to explore the effect of the manufacturing errors on the antenna performance.
